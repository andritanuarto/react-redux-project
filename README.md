### To Run The App

1.  Make sure you cd to ```/issue_explorer```.

2.  run ```npm i``` to install everything.

3.  run ```npm run start``` to start the environment. By the time the process is done it
    should open your browser window on ```http://localhost:3000``` if not just go to that address.

4.  In case if the app doesn't render css. Run ```npm run scss start```.

5.  You can test some urls below to search git issues
    - ```https://github.com/facebook/react```
    - ```https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts```

6.  On ```/issue_explorer/src/config.js``` you can setup the number of issues displayed
    per page ```GIT_ISSUE_PER_PAGE``` max is 100. I also provide pagination next and previous buttons.
